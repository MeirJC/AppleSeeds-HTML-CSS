        <p>
          Ever since I remember my self ive been around computers and passionate
          about technology. <br />
          back when the top of the line was 486 computers... ðŸ˜…
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            id="float-pic"
            src="./images/concertPhoto.jpg"
            alt="Pic of meir in live concert
        "
          />
          Since then ive been through a lot, studied music and worked in that
          area until my early 30's. <br />
          then spent another few years in the academy studying engineering (data
          science and then civil engineering - one year each) in the Technion.
          haven't finished it but learned a lot and really expend my mind about
          math physics and tech.
          <br />i finally ended up doing P.E in civil engineering but for the
          wrong reasons. <br /><br />
          now after all that have I decided to leave it all behind and go the
          kind of career I really want to (and was afraid to go for) <br />
          over the last months im getting all around with self learning courses
          (on platforms such as LinkedIn learning and Udemy) both on
          <strong>Web Development</strong> topics and
          <strong>Data Analytics</strong> and feel very happy to start this
          bootcamp and do it all ion a more organized way, with a group of
          people having the same target.
