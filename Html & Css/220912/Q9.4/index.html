          <p>
            Ever since I remember my self ive been around computers and passionate
            about technology. <br />
            back when the top of the line was 486 computers... 😅

          <p>
            Since then ive been through a lot, studied music and worked in that
            area until my early 30's. <br />
            then spent another few years in the academy studying engineering (data
            science and then civil engineering - one year each) in the Technion.
            haven't finished it but learned a lot and really expend my mind about
            math physics and tech.
            <br />i finally ended up doing P.E in civil engineering but for the
            wrong reasons. <br /><br />
            now after all that have I decided to leave it all behind and go the
            kind of career I really want to (and was afraid to go for) <br />
            over the last months im getting all around with self learning courses
            (on platforms such as LinkedIn learning and Udemy) both on
            <strong>Web Development</strong> topics and
            <strong>Data Analytics</strong> and feel very happy to start this
            bootcamp and do it all ion a more organized way, with a group of
            people having the same target.
